The **FH.Giveaway** application facilitates AI-safety book giveaways for John Sherman's For Humanity Podcast. The solution has been **open-sourced under a MIT license** (see License.md for further details).  Even so, the code is mostly for the author's own personal use so there is no documentation on offer, nor does the author have any intent of documenting the code in the near future.
